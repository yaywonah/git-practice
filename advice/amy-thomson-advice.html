                <h3>Confused? You're not alone!</h3>
                <p>When you start programming your first web page you are doing something that you have NEVER done BEFORE! Doing something for the first time can be <em>scary</em> and <em>challenging</em>. Feeling confused is also a part of the learning process. </p>

                <p>Confusion can cause us to feel a sense of self-doubt in learning to code. When the doubt and fear strikes, it's a good time to reach out to your mentors and peers in Slack. Knowing you are not alone in the process really encourages you to push passed those doubts and fears.</p> 
                
                <p>Remember learning something new and feeling confused means you are headed in the right direction. Think of it like hiking up a mountain. The closer you get to the top, the harder the hike feels. It's usually right about the time your legs and mind want to give up that you reach the peak of success.</p>

                <h3>Get comfortable with being uncomfortable!</h3>
                <p>There are many times throughout the process of learning that we start to feel really uncomfortable. Learning to code means feeling uncomfortable along the way. You start to understand small bits at a time while continuing to not fully grasp the larger picture of coding. There's discomfort in knowing the code is doing something, but not understanding the why or how exactly the code works.  
                </p>

                <p>Just remember! Being uncomfortable is a normal part of the process of learning and means you are moving closer to a better understanding.</p>

                <p>Continuing to practice programming and reading code we don't understand are key to getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. You just don't understand the code...<strong>yet</strong>.</p>
